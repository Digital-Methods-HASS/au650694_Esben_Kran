Use [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9jpe9_2z3c&ab_channel=MacquarieUniversity) as inspiration: A research product and a report. 3000 words ‚ñ∂ 7-8 pages. Types: 1) Data analysis report, 2) technical pipeline, 3) data product, 4) data combination or collection. 

## Ideas:
1. Use [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) of articles related to covid to put light on which demographics the articles use (WEIRD and Western)
2. Use [Wikibooks](https://www.kaggle.com/dhruvildave/wikibooks-dataset) of books in 12 languages to analyse... (keep in mind it's open books etc., does not include publishing data)
   - Word use in diff. languages (translate)
3. Network science on Messenger messages - use closed dataset from Rystr√∏m & Kran, 2021
4. **Rework [this article](https://www.dgsb.dk/blog/hvor-gront-snakker-politikerne-egentlig) and publish it (e.g. w/ HOPE data, multilingually, temporal analysis)**
5. Analysis over the HOPE data timeline for public crisis interest, covid vs. climate vs. war (?) etc.
